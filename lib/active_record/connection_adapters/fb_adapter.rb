    # The Fb adapter relies on the Fb extension.
    #
    # == Usage Notes
    #
    # === Sequence (Generator) Names
    # The Fb adapter supports the same approach adopted for the Oracle
    # adapter. See ActiveRecord::ModelSchema::ClassMethods#sequence_name= for more details.
    #
    # Note that in general there is no need to create a <tt>BEFORE INSERT</tt>
    # trigger corresponding to a Firebird sequence generator when using
    # ActiveRecord. In other words, you don't have to try to make Firebird
    # simulate an <tt>AUTO_INCREMENT</tt> or +IDENTITY+ column. When saving a
    # new record, ActiveRecord pre-fetches the next sequence value for the table
    # and explicitly includes it in the +INSERT+ statement. (Pre-fetching the
    # next primary key value is the only reliable method for the Fb
    # adapter to report back the +id+ after a successful insert.)
    #
    # === BOOLEAN Domain
    # Firebird 2.5 does not provide a native +BOOLEAN+ type (Only in Firebird 3.x). But you can easily
    # define a +BOOLEAN+ _domain_ for this purpose, e.g.:
    #
    #  CREATE DOMAIN D_BOOLEAN AS SMALLINT CHECK (VALUE IN (0, 1));
    #
    # When the Fb adapter encounters a column that is based on a domain
    # that includes "BOOLEAN" in the domain name, it will attempt to treat
    # the column as a +BOOLEAN+.
    #
    # By default, the Fb adapter will assume that the BOOLEAN domain is
    # defined as above.  This can be modified if needed.  For example, if you
    # have a legacy schema with the following +BOOLEAN+ domain defined:
    #
    #  CREATE DOMAIN BOOLEAN AS CHAR(1) CHECK (VALUE IN ('T', 'F'));
    #
    # ...you can add the following line to your <tt>environment.rb</tt> file:
    #
    #  ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::FbAdapter.boolean_domain = { :true => 'T', :false => 'F', :name => 'BOOLEAN', :type => 'char' }
    #
    # === Column Name Case Semantics
    # Firebird and ActiveRecord have somewhat conflicting case semantics for
    # column names.
    #
    # [*Firebird*]
    #   The standard practice is to use unquoted column names, which can be
    #   thought of as case-insensitive. (In fact, Firebird converts them to
    #   uppercase.) Quoted column names (not typically used) are case-sensitive.
    # [*ActiveRecord*]
    #   Attribute accessors corresponding to column names are case-sensitive.
    #   The defaults for primary key and inheritance columns are lowercase, and
    #   in general, people use lowercase attribute names.
    #
    # In order to map between the differing semantics in a way that conforms
    # to common usage for both Firebird and ActiveRecord, uppercase column names
    # in Firebird are converted to lowercase attribute names in ActiveRecord,
    # and vice-versa. Mixed-case column names retain their case in both
    # directions. Lowercase (quoted) Firebird column names are not supported.
    # This is similar to the solutions adopted by other adapters.
    #
    # In general, the best approach is to use unquoted (case-insensitive) column
    # names in your Firebird DDL (or if you must quote, use uppercase column
    # names). These will correspond to lowercase attributes in ActiveRecord.
    #
    # For example, a Firebird table based on the following DDL:
    #
    #  CREATE TABLE products (
    #    id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    #    "TYPE" VARCHAR(50),
    #    name VARCHAR(255) );
    #
    # ...will correspond to an ActiveRecord model class called +Product+ with
    # the following attributes: +id+, +type+, +name+.
    #
    # ==== Quoting <tt>"TYPE"</tt> and other Firebird reserved words:
    # In ActiveRecord, the default inheritance column name is +type+. The word
    # _type_ is a Firebird reserved word, so it must be quoted in any Firebird
    # SQL statements. Because of the case mapping described above, you should
    # always reference this column using quoted-uppercase syntax
    # (<tt>"TYPE"</tt>) within Firebird DDL or other SQL statements (as in the
    # example above). This holds true for any other Firebird reserved words used
    # as column names as well.
    #
    # === Migrations
    # The Fb adapter currently support Migrations.
    #
    # == Connection Options
    # The following options are supported by the Fb adapter.
    #
    # <tt>:database</tt>::
    #   <i>Required option.</i> Specifies one of: (i) a Firebird database alias;
    #   (ii) the full path of a database file; _or_ (iii) a full Firebird
    #   connection string. <i>Do not specify <tt>:host</tt>, <tt>:service</tt>
    #   or <tt>:port</tt> as separate options when using a full connection
    #   string.</i>
    # <tt>:username</tt>::
    #   Specifies the database user. Defaults to 'sysdba'.
    # <tt>:password</tt>::
    #   Specifies the database password. Defaults to 'masterkey'.
    # <tt>:charset</tt>::
    #   Specifies the character set to be used by the connection. Refer to the
    #   Firebird documentation for valid options.
